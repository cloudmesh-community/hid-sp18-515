Apache HBase\cite{hid-sp18-515-www-hbase}is a distributed, scalable, 
big data store, Hadoop database. 
You can use Apache HBase when you need random, realtime read/write 
access to your Big Data.
The goal of HBase is hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows 
X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware.
Apache HBase is modeled after Google's Bigtable: "A Distributed Storage 
System for Structured Data by Chang et al."
And it is open-source, distributed, non-relational database.
Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS, 
just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by 
the Google File System.

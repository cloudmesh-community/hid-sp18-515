\section{CouchDB}

CouchDB\cite{hip-sp18-515-www-couchdb} is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data 
with JSON documents. Access your documents with your web browser, 
via HTTP. Query, combine, and transform your documents with JavaScript. 
CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You can distribute 
your data, efficiently using CouchDBâ€™s incremental replication. CouchDB 
supports master-master setups with automatic conflict detection.
CouchDB comes with a suite of features, such as on-the-fly document 
transformation and real-time change notifications, that make web 
development a breeze. It even comes with an easy to use web 
administration console, served directly out of CouchDB! We care a lot 
about distributed scaling. CouchDB is highly available and partition 
tolerant, but is also eventually consistent. And we care a lot about 
your data. CouchDB has a fault-tolerant storage engine that puts the 
safety of your data first.

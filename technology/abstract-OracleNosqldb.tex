\section{Oracle Nosql Database}

Oracle NoSQL Database\cite{hid-sp18-515-www-oraclenosql} is a 
scalable, distributed NoSQL database, designed to provide highly 
reliable, flexible and available data management across a 
configurable set of storage nodes.
Data can be modeled as relational-database-style tables, JSON 
documents or key-value pairs. Oracle NoSQL Database is a sharded 
(shared-nothing) system which distributes the data uniformly across 
the multiple shards in the cluster, based on the hashed value of the 
primary key. Within each shard, storage nodes are replicated to ensure 
high availability, rapid failover in the event of a node failure and 
optimal load balancing of queries. NoSQL Database provides Java, C, 
Python and Node.js drivers and a REST API to simplify application 
development. Oracle NoSQL Database is integrated with a wide variety 
of related Oracle and open source applications in order to simplify 
and streamline the development and deployment of modern big data 
applications. Â Oracle NoSQL Database is available in the following 
editions: 
Enterprise Edition - Oracle Commercial License
Basic Edition * - Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Commercial

Community Edition - Open source license

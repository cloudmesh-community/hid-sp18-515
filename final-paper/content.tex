\section{Introduction}

Pychology problem is getting more and more attention in the morden 
society. And as the big data technology is such a heated topic today, 
the combination of this two fields should be well applied.

Big data is particularly good at dealing with issues that people may 
be reluctant to answer surveys. Often, the way people interact with 
computers reveals the interest they would not express in interviews 
or anonymous surveys\cite{hid-sp18-515-editor00}.

Therefore, it is easier and even more justified for big data technique 
being applied in pychology fields than the traditional statistic methods.
